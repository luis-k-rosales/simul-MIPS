# simul-MIPS
Class projects for simul-MIPS
This is a repository to collect code for the EL4313 class in Tecnologico de Costa Rica. This code is intended to develop a functional MIPS microprocessor simulator entirely using x86_64 assembly instructions.

This is not intended to be released as a functional project, but to offer some practical example for students with source code management and development techniques.
